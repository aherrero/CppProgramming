// RECOGNIZING A SWIMMING POOL ON SATELLITE IMAGES
// This algorithm was developed for the test of knowledge of the company Dacuda.
// The objective is to seek outdoor pools of some satellite images of Google Maps.
//
// For that, It is possible obtain images in Google Maps in the view “Earth”,
// without Labels(Menu Earth->Labels off), from a distance of 100 meters, in a full screen (my computer size is 1366x768)
// and take a screen capture(Print screen button).
//
// The application works with an input image, like “image.png”, and it will recognize the swimming pools and the measures.
// For that, the algorithms also recognize the Google Maps scale(At bottom right of the image)
// and apply the pixel to meters transformation.
// The algorithm is thinking for big swimming pools(public) so maybe it will not work with private swimming pools.

// The application was developed in Windows 8.1 platform, in the Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 IDE.
// This code is written in C++, use the OpenCV libraries for the image recognition and STL in some case.
